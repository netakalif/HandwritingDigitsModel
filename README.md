# HandwritingDigitsModel

This program was created as part of the "Introduction to Data Science" course for the purpose of training and cataloging images of handwritten literature. The K-means algorithm was implemented by the developers themselves, and success rates were calculated using two different methods - initializing random centers and initializing existing data centers. The program was written entirely in Python.

The project is the first project I wrote in python.

## Installation:

Download the program files from the repository
Install Python 3.6 or higher
