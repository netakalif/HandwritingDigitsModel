# HandwritingDigitsModel

As part of the "Introduction to Data Science" course that I am taking as part of my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, we were asked to create a program that trains and catalogs images of handwritten literature. We wrote the K-means algorithms ourselves and calculated the success rates by initializing random centers, and initializing existing data centers.
The project is the first project I wrote in python.
